Eye Detection System using OpenCV and Python
This project detects and highlights human eyes in real-time or from images/videos using OpenCV. It's a foundational computer vision task that can be used in applications like drowsiness detection, attention tracking, and more.

🔍 Features
Detects human eyes using Haar cascade classifiers

Works on both image and video inputs

Real-time webcam support (optional)

Highlights each detected eye with bounding boxes

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV (with pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers)

NumPy

🚀 How It Works
Load the image, video, or webcam feed

Convert the input to grayscale

Use OpenCV’s Haar cascade for eye detection

Draw bounding boxes around detected eyes

Display the annotated output
